1. Information We Collect
WhatsAppify does not collect, store, or require any personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists. The app does not require user accounts, registration, or login.

3. Local Data Storage
The App may store limited data locally on the user's device, such as recent chat history or user preferences, solely to improve user experience. This data never leaves the device and can be cleared at any time by clearing the app data or uninstalling the app.

4. Permissions
WhatsAppify requests only the minimum permissions required for core functionality. The App does not access contacts, call logs, messages, photos, or media files without explicit user action.

WhatsAppify uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect limited, non-personal information such as device identifiers, advertising IDs, and usage data in order to provide and improve ads. This data is collected and processed in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

We do not control or have access to the data collected by AdMob.
