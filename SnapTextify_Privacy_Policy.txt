- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Photos or media files

- Access your files without permission

3. Permissions Used
SnapTextify may request the following permissions:

These permissions are used strictly for core app functionality.

AdMob may collect limited non-personal data such as:

We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.
